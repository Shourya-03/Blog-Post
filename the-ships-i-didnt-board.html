<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Ships I didn't board: "Oh God why didn't you rescues me?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>I know what I want out of life. Every day I tell myself, “Tomorrow, things will change.” But the truth is, I haven’t taken a single step toward that change.</p>
<p><strong>My goal?</strong> To live by divine wisdom.</p>
<p>The oldest books carry this wisdom. It makes no sense for me to try and reinvent the wheel — yet I struggle. I live in an environment that constantly conflicts with these values. And when you live in conflict long enough, the environment begins to shape you.</p>
<h2>⚓ Life on the Ship</h2>
<p>It’s like being on a ship. The sailors have already set their course. Trying to steer them elsewhere feels like madness.</p>
<p>Can you imagine saying, “We’re changing course,” only to hear, “Go f*** off”?</p>
<p>So, you stay quiet… pretending you're the captain.</p>
<p>This metaphor isn’t just poetic. The ship and sailors? That’s my home. That’s my children. Trying to move a whole household in a new direction feels impossible.</p>
<p>And yet, every du'a I make is for exactly that — to sail toward the unconventional. To live a life aligned with something higher than modern noise.</p>
<h2>🧭 The Signs Begin</h2>
<p>But why am I writing this?</p>
<p>It started with my son. He couldn’t conform to the rules at school — and deep down, I understood him. Because he’s me. A younger version of the same storm.</p>
<p>The first wake-up call came when I discovered a policy at his school. On the surface, it was a “non-faith” institution. But its mission and daily routine quietly pushed a hidden agenda of indoctrination — one that didn’t quite align with my beliefs.</p>
<p>I was shocked to discover my suspicions were true. There, in black and white, their policies spelled out their aim to “indoctrinate.”</p>
<p>I don’t mind faith-based schools — but why hide it from the public? Well, I’ll leave you to your thoughts…</p>
<p><strong>That was sign #1.</strong></p>
<h2>🚑 Then Came the Nurse</h2>
<p>I was meant to see her for 10 minutes in A&amp;E.</p>
<p>Instead, she shared her own story — of changing the course of her own ship, just as I hoped to do with mine.</p>
<p>She was deeply inspirational and refreshingly different from the usual rhetoric. She was as unconventional as they come — even when it came to her views on modern medicine.</p>
<p><strong>That was sign #2.</strong></p>
<h2>🥥 The Coconut Boy</h2>
<p>Then I met a 16-year-old boy who had dropped out of school at 13. He was selling coconut drinks on the streets — no textbooks, no desks in sight.</p>
<p>But he shared with me his thoughts on public education — and how he was already running four businesses at just 16 years old.</p>
<p>He didn’t follow society’s rules. And yet, he was thriving.</p>
<p><strong>That was sign #3.</strong></p>
<h2>🧱 The Builder</h2>
<p>Then I met the talented builder. He had moved from the US, then to Jordan, and eventually to the UK — where we met. He moved quite freely, like a bird.</p>
<p>He didn’t have a large chunk of savings, but his currency was skill. Or shall I say… gold fingers?</p>
<p>No school is going to tell you these truths. I doubt the teachers who teach in them even have the time to realize them.</p>
<h2>💔 The Moment That Broke Me Open</h2>
<p>Finally came the moment that broke me open.</p>
<p>I was homeschooling my son — the one who “doesn’t conform.” I gave him a writing assignment.</p>
<p>He ignored it.</p>
<p>Instead, he wrote a joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a man drowning at sea. He prayed to God for help.</p>
<p>First came a big ship. He refused it.</p>
<p>Then came another ship. He refused again.</p>
<p>Then came a helicopter. Still, he refused.</p>
<p>Later, when he drowned, he asked God, “Why didn’t You save me?”</p>
<p>God replied, “I sent you two ships and a helicopter, you dummy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s when it hit me.</p>
<p>All my du'as…</p>
<p>Maybe the nurse, the boy, the school incident, the builder and perhaps even this joke,</p>
<p>maybe those were my ships.</p>
<p>And I was too blind to see them.</p>
<p>Maybe the help I was waiting for… already came.</p>
